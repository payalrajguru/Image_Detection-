# Image_Detection-

Converted the sample images into dataframe, splitted the data into test and train. Used
various classification techniques like KNN Classifier, Logistic regression, SVC with liner,
polynomial and rbf kernel, Random Forest etc with hyperparameter tuning.
Successfully created Random Forest model with the accuracy of 93.25% and saved as
pickel file using serialization.
Made streamlit app where we import the image in which we preprocess the test image
and display the prediction using Random Forest algorithm
